**Linear Equation Solver**

This program is designed to take in 2 linear equations in the form of "ax + by = c" and return the solution in the form of "x = value" and "y = value" or indicate that there is no solution or infinitely many solutions.

The program uses the following approach:

It starts by taking in two equations as input from the user in the form of "ax + by = c"
It then separates the equations into LHS and RHS and separates the terms with respect to their coefficient of x and y.
Next, it performs necessary mathematical operation on the separated terms to finally get the solutions of the equations.
It then prints the solutions in the form of "x = value" and "y = value" or indicate that there is no solution or infinitely many solutions.
Example of use:
Enter the first equation:
4x + 2y = 10
Enter the second equation:
3x + 6y = 18
Equations in the simplified form:
2x+1y=5
x+2y=6
Solution:
x=2
y=2

**Limitations**

This program is only capable of solving 2 linear equations. It's not designed to solve non-linear equations. Also, it's only designed to work with integers, it will not work with decimals or fractions.

**Note**

It's not guaranteed that the output will be correct, please double check before use.
