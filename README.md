The codes in this repository are the assignments of the CENG113 coded course given by Nesli Erdoğmuş in the 2020 Spring semester. The purpose of this repository is to provide preliminary information about the coding that will be done by the first year and preparatory students and the concepts they will learn during the semester. You can contribute to the development by opening discussions on the codes. Good luck everyone.
